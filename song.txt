[Intro: Travis Scott & Donda West]
That she wrote, "Speech to the Young: Speech to the Progress-Toward"
Say to them, say to the down-keepers, the sun-slappers
The self-soilers, the harmony-hushers
Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night
Serve, flex, I do work (Work)
Six, I'm like Mike
He's out of sight, woo
You done got me piped
Two-man like Ike
Six out the spot (Uh, uh)
Into the night
[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Kanye West]
Yeah, I'm shakin' the drop (Drop)
I'm still up on top (Aight)
I been had the bop
The devil my opp, can't pay me to stop (It's lit)
My God at the top (La Flame)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Donda West]
We gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg
Livin', speakin', praise God
Walkin' out the graveyard back to life
I serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night (Hey)
